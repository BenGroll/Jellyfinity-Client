# Changelog

All notable changes to Jellyfinity are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Initialized the Flutter Android and iOS application.
- Added the reproducible development container.
- Added Windows-hosted Android emulator support through ADB.
- Added the initial Jellyfinity development shell.
- Added the application architecture core: feature-first Clean
  Architecture direction (ADR-0001), `flutter_bloc` state management
  (ADR-0002), `get_it`/`injectable` dependency composition (ADR-0003), a
  shared `Result`/`Failure`/`Partial` model (ADR-0004), and privacy-safe
  logging/configuration conventions (ADR-0005), each with focused tests.
- Added navigation with `go_router` (ADR-0006): a composition-root
  `AppRouter`, an auth gate driven by a stubbed `SessionCubit`
  (`unauthenticated` → welcome, `authenticated` → shell), a
  `StatefulShellRoute` app shell (Home section only for now), and a
  not-found route.
- Added the `lib/design/` design system (ADR-0007): semantic tokens for
  colour, spacing, radii, typography, elevation, and motion, delivered as
  a `ThemeExtension` and read through `context.tokens`; dark-first light
  and dark themes; and shared UX primitives — `AppScaffold`, shimmering
  `AppSkeleton`/`AppSkeletonList`, `EmptyStateView`, `ErrorStateView`
  (with failure-aware retry), `UnavailableContent`, and `AppButton`.
- Replaced the placeholder development shell with the real welcome and
  Home screens built on the design system.
- Added the Jellyfin transport layer (ADR-0008) under
  `lib/infrastructure/jellyfin/`: a `dio`-based `JellyfinHttpClient` whose
  request surface returns `Result` and never leaks a `DioException`;
  centralized `JellyfinClientIdentity` building the Jellyfin
  `Authorization` header, with an `AuthTokenProvider` seam for v0.0.5;
  `dio` interceptors for the identity/auth header, debug request
  correlation, and bounded GET-only retry; `JellyfinServerUrl`
  normalization; `ServerVersion` plus a one-line `MinimumServerVersionPolicy`
  (floor: Jellyfin 10.11.6); a `json_serializable` `PublicSystemInfoDto`;
  `TransportErrorMapper` normalizing transport failures to the ADR-0004
  model; and `JellyfinServerProbe.validate()` to check a server is
  reachable, really Jellyfin, and supported.
- Added `UnauthorizedFailure` and `UnsupportedServerFailure` to the core
  `Failure` hierarchy (note added to ADR-0004).
- Added `dio`, `json_annotation`, and `json_serializable` (dev)
  dependencies.
- Added authentication, servers, and sessions (ADR-0009). `lib/domain/`
  gains its first content — the session concepts kept distinct
  (`JellyfinServer`, `JellyfinAccount`, `AuthSession`) and their
  contracts (`ServerRegistry`, `AccountStore`, `CredentialStore`,
  `JellyfinAuthenticator`). A real user journey now works end to end:
  enter a server address → validate it → sign in with a Jellyfin
  username/password (`AuthenticateByName`) → the session is restored on
  the next launch (no network call, so a currently-offline server does
  not block startup) → switch profile, sign out, or remove a saved
  profile/server from the new Accounts screen. Polished connecting and
  error states throughout; no raw exception text in the UI.
- Access tokens are stored in platform secure storage
  (`flutter_secure_storage`: iOS Keychain, Android Keystore-backed
  `EncryptedSharedPreferences`). The non-secret saved-servers/profiles
  registry uses a small JSON-file store behind the domain contracts as
  an explicit interim until the v0.0.6 database.
- `SessionAuthTokenProvider` replaces `NoAuthTokenProvider` as the
  transport layer's token source; `JellyfinHttpClient` gained a
  `postJson` surface.
- The router's onboarding flow (`/connect`, `/connect/sign-in`) and the
  `/accounts` screen; the welcome screen now starts the connect flow
  instead of a development shortcut.
- Added `flutter_secure_storage`, `path_provider`, and `uuid`
  dependencies.
